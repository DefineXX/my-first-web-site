<p>[Intro: Justin Bieber]
  As long as you love me
  (Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, love me)
  As long as you love me
  (Love me, love me, love me, love me)
  As long as you love me</p>
<p style = "margin-top:21 px;">[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
  We're under pressure (We're under pressure)
  Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in (Tryna fit in)
  Keep it together (Keep it together)
  Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning (Frowning)
  But hey now (Hey now), you know, girl (You know, girl)
  We both know, it's a cruel world (Cruel world)
  But I will (But I will) take my chances</p>
